def ReadDMSCounts(f, chartype):
    """Reads deep mutational scanning counts.

    *f* is a readable file-like object that contains the counts, or 
    a string that gives the name of a file.

    *chartype* is the type of character. Valid values are the following strings:

        - *DNA* : DNA nucleotides, those listed in the *nts* variable
          defined in this module.

        - *codon* : DNA codons, those listed in the *codons* variable
          defined in this module.

        - *aminoacids_nostop* : amino acids, not including stop codons.

        - *aminoacids_withstop* : amino acids, including stop codons (``*``).

    The counts are returned in the dictionary *counts*. The dictionary
    is keyed by **strings** giving the position (e.g. '1', '2', or '5A').
    For each position *r*, *strings[r]* is a dictionary keyed by the
    string *WT* and all characters (nucleotides or codons) as specified
    by *chartype*, in upper case. *counts[r]['WT']* is the wildtype identity
    at the site; *counts[r][x]* is the number of counts for character *x*.

    The specifications on the format of the contents of *f* are as follows:

        * Any lines beginning with *#* are treated as comments or headers, 
          and do not contain data.

        * Columns are space delimited. They can separated by one or more 
          spaces, or by one or more tabs.

        * Before the first data line (a line **not** beginning with *#*) 
          there must be a header line beginning with *# POSITION WT* and 
          then followed in arbitrary order by entries specifying valid 
          DNA nucleotides or valid DNA codons. The order of the entries 
          in this header line establish the order of the data in subsequent lines.

        * The case does matter, all nucleotides and codons **must be upper case**.

        * It is OK to intersperse columns that do not represent valid codons 
          or nucleotides as long as all of the codons or nucleotides are present. 
          This might be useful if you file is using *N* to denote ambiguous 
          nucleotides (which are ignored as not being definitive counts), or 
          is using lower-case letters (such as *a* to denote unsure calls).

        * For every data line, the first two entries will be *POSITION* and *WT*:

            - *POSITION* is the position number. These do not have to be 
              consecutive integers, so it is OK to skip sites (e.g. *1*, *2*, *5*) 
              or have negative site numbers (e.g. *-1*, *0*, *1*) or have sites 
              with letter suffixes (e.g. *1*, *2*, *2A*, *3*). All of these 
              options are useful when referring to numbering schemes that are 
              non-sequential, as is sometimes the case in gene numbering. Note 
              however that each position number must be unique.

            - *WT* must give a valid wildtype identity of the site as a 
               nucleotide or codon.

    extra lines / columns.

    """Iterates over FASTQ file pairs for paired-end sequencing reads.

    This function has been tested for its ability to read FASTQ files
    generated by the Illumina Casava 1.8 pipeline for paired-end reads.

    CALLING VARIABLES:

    `r1files` : list of file name(s) containing the R1 reads.

    `r2files` : list of file name(s) containing the R2 reads. The files
    specified here must specify the exact same number of reads as
    those in `r1files`, and they must be in the same sequence (i.e.
    the first R1 read found going through `r1files` in order must
    match the first R2 read found going through `r2files` in order,
    etc).

    `gzipped` : Boolean switch specifying whether the FASTQ files
    specified by `r1files` and `r2files` are gzipped. If set to `True`,
    they are gzipped. This iterator will then read them without
    unzipping the files.

    `applyfilter` : Boolean switch specifying whether we remove read
    pairs in which one or more of the reads failed the Illumina
    chastity filter. If `True`, the iterator simply returns `False`
    each time it encounters a read pair where the chastity filter is
    failed. The chastity filter is indicated by Y or N in the
    sequence header -- values of Y indicate a failed filter.

    `usegzip` : Boolean switch that is meaningful only if `gzipped`
    is `True`. This specifies that we use the Python ``gzip`` module to 
    unzip the reads. Otherwise we use the system ``gzip -cd command``,
    which may be faster. You should definitely specify
    `usegzip` to `True` if you are only reading a few lines, as with
    `usegzip` set to `False` the entire file is unzipped before anything happens.
    `False` by default.

    RESULT OF THIS FUNCTION:

    The function will iterate over all read pairs in the indicated
    files. For each iteration, it will return:

    * The return variable is `False` if ``applyfilter == True`` and one of the
      reads in the pair failed the Illumina chastity filter. 
    
    * Otherwise return variable is the following tuple:
      `(name, r1, r2, q1, q2)` where:

      - `name` : name of the read pair (a string)

      - `r1` : sequence of the first read R1 (a string)

      - `r2` : sequence of the second read R2 (a string)

      - `q1` : string of Q-scores for the R1 read 

      - `q2` : string of Q-scores for the R2 read

    """Reads alignment summary statistics.

    *f* should be either a readable file-like object or a string giving
    the name of an existing file that contains alignment summary statistics.
    For instance, this might be the ``summarystats.txt`` file produced by
    ``dms_barcodedsubamplicons``. Here is example content from such
    a file::

        total read pairs = 4580258

        low quality read pairs = 915131
        barcodes randomly purged = 0

        aligned barcodes with 2 reads = 466387
        discarded barcodes with 2 reads = 6457
        un-alignable barcodes with 2 reads = 40753
        aligned barcodes with 3 reads = 262149
        discarded barcodes with 3 reads = 5426
        un-alignable barcodes with 3 reads = 24891

        un-alignable barcodes with 5 reads = 2863

    The return value is the 2-tuple *(keylist, stats)*.
    *keylist* is a list of all of the keys in *f* (these
    are the strings before the equals sign) in the same
    order as they appear in the file. *stats* is a dictionary
    keyed by each key in *keylist* and with the value being
    an integer giving the number of counts for that key.
    The reason for returning *keylist* as well as *stats*
    is that *keylist* preserves the order of the entries in *f*,
    whereas the dictionary *stats* will have an arbitrary order.

    Any lines in *f* that begin with ``#`` are treated
    as comments and are not processed into the return 
    variables.

Changelog
===========

1.1.15
-------
* In ``dms_diffselection``, the pseudocounts are now scaled by the **smaller** depth library at each site.

1.1.14
------
* Added ``dms_diffselection`` program.

* Added ``--colormap`` and ``--overlay3`` options to ``dms_logoplot``

* Make ``dms_merge`` remove sites indicated as *None* when in *renumber* mode, added ``--skipfirstline`` option, and made commas an allowable separator.

* Increased number of colors allowed by *PlotMutCountFracs* (used by ``dms_summarizealignments``)

1.1.13
-----------
* Moved repository and docs from https://github.com/jbloom/dms_tools and http://jbloom.github.io/dms_tools to https://github.com/jbloomlab/dms_tools and http://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools

* Catch problems with ``dms_merge`` if multiple input files of the same name.

1.1.12
-------------
* Added option to sum count files in ``dms_merge``, with or without normalization of counts at each site. 

* Updated *dms_tools.file_io.IteratePairedFASTQ* to permit parsing of FASTQ files generated by ``fastq-dump``. 

1.1.11
-------------
* Fixed bug in ``dms_merge``, where normalization of prefs or diffprefs was not occurring when the user provided two or more identical pref or diffpref files

* Added y-axis label override option in ``plot.PlotDepth()`` and corrected ``dms_summarizealignments`` to label the y-axis as 'number of barcodes' when summarizing barcoded subamplicon data.

* Added ``merge_method`` choice ``rescale`` to ``dms_merge`` to rescale a preferences file by a ``--stringencyparameter``.

1.1.9
-------------
* Added option to trim reads R1 and R2 in ``dms_barcodedsubamplicons``

1.1.8
--------
* Fixed algorithm to estimate preferences and differential preferences using the ``--ratio_estimation`` option for both ``dms_inferprefs`` and ``dms_inferdiffprefs``.

* Fixed small bug in *dms_tools.file_io.WriteDiffPrefs* and in test suite.

1.1.7
--------
* ``dms_logoplot`` can now handle sites numbers that don't go sequentially starting with one or zero.

1.1.6
-------
Added ``--stringencyparameter`` option to ``dms_logoplot``.

1.1.5
---------
* Added additional options for logo plots showing preferences and differential preferences 

1.1.4
----------
* Some minor documentation updates

* Added ``--ratio_estimation`` option to ``dms_inferdiffprefs``

1.1.3
--------
* Some minor documentation corrections; added BMC Bioinformatics (2015) citation

* Fixed minor bug in error handling by ``dms_editsites`` when there is an invalid file name.

* Added more detailed error message for invalid ``ydatamax`` in ``dms_logoplot``

1.1.2
--------
* Fixed bug in ``dms_summarizealignments`` processing of ``summarystats.txt`` files when ``--purgefracs`` is nonzero.

* Added ``--writemutfreqs`` option to ``dms_summarizealignments``

1.1.1
-------
* Fixed duplication of logging output by ``dms_inferprefs``

* Fixed bug that caused a crash during calculation of average mutation rate by ``dms_inferprefs`` when some sites have no counts data

* Fixed problems in MCMC convergence in ``dms_inferprefs`` and ``dms_inferdiffprefs`` when there are many Rhat values of ``nan`` by being more accommodating on the Rhat criterion if N_eff is sufficiently large

* Added test for ``dms_barcodedsubamplicons`` in ``./tests/``

* Some minor documentation updates

1.1.0
------
* Added ``dms_barcodedsubamplicons`` and ``dms_summarizealignments` programs

1.0.1
--------
* Fixed bug in parsing *codon* option in ``dms_infeprefs`` and ``dms_inferdiffprefs``

* Relaxed convergence criterion for cases when *R* is ``nan`` for a few sites in MCMC

* Some minor documentation updates

1.0.0
--------
Initial release

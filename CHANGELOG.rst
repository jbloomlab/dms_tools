1.1.16
--------
* Added ``--mincounts`` option to ``dms_diffselection``, and make ``dms_logoplot`` properly plot differential selection with missing values.

* Added test (``./tests/test_diffselection.py``) for ``dms_diffselection``

* ``dms_barcodedsubamplicons`` now gives exactly reproducible output regardless of order of input reads. 

1.1.15

1.1.13
-----------
* Moved repository and docs from https://github.com/jbloom/dms_tools and http://jbloom.github.io/dms_tools to https://github.com/jbloomlab/dms_tools and http://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools

* Catch problems with ``dms_merge`` if multiple input files of the same name.

1.1.12
-------------
* Added option to sum count files in ``dms_merge``, with or without normalization of counts at each site. 

* Updated *dms_tools.file_io.IteratePairedFASTQ* to permit parsing of FASTQ files generated by ``fastq-dump``. 

1.1.11
-------------
* Fixed bug in ``dms_merge``, where normalization of prefs or diffprefs was not occurring when the user provided two or more identical pref or diffpref files

* Added y-axis label override option in ``plot.PlotDepth()`` and corrected ``dms_summarizealignments`` to label the y-axis as 'number of barcodes' when summarizing barcoded subamplicon data.

* Added ``merge_method`` choice ``rescale`` to ``dms_merge`` to rescale a preferences file by a ``--stringencyparameter``.

1.1.9
-------------
* Added option to trim reads R1 and R2 in ``dms_barcodedsubamplicons``

1.1.8
--------
* Fixed algorithm to estimate preferences and differential preferences using the ``--ratio_estimation`` option for both ``dms_inferprefs`` and ``dms_inferdiffprefs``.

* Fixed small bug in *dms_tools.file_io.WriteDiffPrefs* and in test suite.

1.1.7
--------
* ``dms_logoplot`` can now handle sites numbers that don't go sequentially starting with one or zero.

1.1.6
-------
* Added ``--stringencyparameter`` option to ``dms_logoplot``.

1.1.5
---------
* Added additional options for logo plots showing preferences and differential preferences 

1.1.4
----------
* Some minor documentation updates

* Added ``--ratio_estimation`` option to ``dms_inferdiffprefs``

1.1.3

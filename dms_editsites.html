<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dms_editsites</span></tt> is a program included with the <a class="reference external" href="http://jbloom.github.io/dms_tools">dms_tools</a> package. It is designed for renumbering sites, or removing data for specific ones.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#examples">Examples</a> for illustrations of how you might do this.</p>
<p>After you install <a class="reference external" href="http://jbloom.github.io/dms_tools">dms_tools</a>, this program will be available to run at the command line.</p>
